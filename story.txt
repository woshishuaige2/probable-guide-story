There is a guy named Josh. One Saturday he is playing badminto with his friends and he got injured on the court.

Even thought he thought little of his injury, his teammate's concern for his wellbeing convinced him to go to the hospital. Josh had thought that he would be in and out with a brace in the worst possible case, but the grim looks of the doctors made his heart drop. The news that he would never be able to walk again filled his with agony.
